# The LIT Lab Style Guide

As a general rule the LIT Lab follows the *[Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)*. For tutorials that involve technical terms and user interface elements, the LIT Lab follows the *[Microsoft Manual of Style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)*. For guided interviews, the Document Assembly Line documentation includes a [detailed style guide](https://assemblyline.suffolklitlab.org/docs/style_guide/question_overview).

This style guide includes some preferences and addresses some special cases.

## Capitalizing titles and headings

In general, use sentence case for titles and headings. Use title case for the following:

* Titles of Docassemble interviews ([Affidavit Disclosing Care or Custody Proceedings](https://courtformsonline.org/ma/forms/affidavit-disclosing-care-or-custody-proceedings))
* Titles of documents and publications ([LIT Lab Style Guide](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/styleguide) and [LIT Blog](https://suffolklitlab.org/blog/))
* Names of things like projects ([Document Assembly Line](https://assemblyline.suffolklitlab.org/)) software ([QnA Markup](https://www.qnamarkup.org/) and [Find My Cite](https://findmycite.org/)), classes ([Legal Tech Class](https://projects.suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/)), conferences, ([LIT Con](https://suffolklitlab.org/events/lit-con/)), and teams (LIT Clinic & Fellows) in Microsoft Teams (but not channels)
* Blog post categories ([Access to Justice Innovation](https://suffolklitlab.org/category/access-to-justice-innovation/)) but not tags ([artificial intelligence](https://suffolklitlab.org/tag/artificial-intelligence/)) unless the tag falls under one of the above exceptions

[This is a handy tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com/) for title case capitalization. (Make sure the *Chicago Manual of Style* radio button is selected.)

## Punctuation in titles and headings

Since the *Chicago Manual of Style* does not include guidelines for punctuation in titles and headings, here are some guidelines:

* Periods are unnecessary unless the heading contains multiple sentences. If the heading contains multiple sentences, use the appropriate punctuation after each one.
* If the heading is a question or exclamation, include the question mark or exclamation point
* Use the serial comma if the heading contains a list of three or more things

The same guidelines should be used for most bulleted or numbered lists.
